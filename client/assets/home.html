        <p class="desc">CAs are assigned a range of tasks from time to time. These tasks range from carrying out publicity to organizing workshops. Every task carries a fixed number of points, which are awarded upon completion of the task. For example​, one post shared on Facebook can give the CA one point. Tasks which require more efforts like conducting on-ground publicity shall carry higher points. CAs are required to complete a fixed minimum number of points to receive the marketing internship certificate. Those who grab extra points will be eligible to receive additional incentives such as goodies.
